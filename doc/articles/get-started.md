# Get started with Uno Platform

Welcome to Uno Platform! You'll be creating cross-platform applications with XAML and C# in no time.

To help you set up your development environment, we need to know what operating system you're developing on, and what's your preferred IDE.

**I am developing with...**

 - [Windows](#windows)
 - [macOS](#macos)
 - [Linux](#linux)

 ## Windows

If you're developing on Windows, our recommended IDE is Visual Studio, for the richest XAML development experience. But if you prefer to use Rider or Visual Studio Code, you can - you'll just get less hints when you're writing XAML markup.

 ## macOS

If you're developing on macOS, you have a few options. You can use Visual Studio for Mac, Rider, or Visual Studio for Code.

 ## Linux

 If you're developing on Linux we've got you covered - you can use either Rider or Visual Studio Code to build Uno Platform applications.
