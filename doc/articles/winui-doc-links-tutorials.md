# WinUI documentation - Tutorials

You can work through these tutorials either as single-platform UWP applications or as multi-platform Uno Platform applications. In the latter case, when the tutorial instructs you to create a new UWP application in Visual Studio, you should create a [new Uno Platform application](get-started.md) instead.
